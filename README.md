# Pod Zero

<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;[W]e should [..] view institutions as webs of enabling constraints that may create rich or poor adjacent possibilities for agents in the system. Redundancy, degeneracy, adaptivity, diversity, &amp; resilience may better predict performance in unforeseen situations. Generating desired aggregate outcomes indirectly through the learning and adaptation of multiple interacting agents allows the system to adapt to novelty and leverages the combinatorial explosion that defeats Rawlsian institutional design.&#8217;<br/>

Pod Zero is a personal data vault architecture, built using [Solid](https://solidproject.org/developers/), that interprets users as autonomous agents in a formally open web, as a form of political-economic self-organisation ***designed to be formally commensurate to the cascade of negative synergies around climate change.***

While the complexity of this cascade of shocks is formally beyond the capacity of conventional institutional design, an agent-based mode of dynamic social organisation using Solid is formally capable of addressing this complexity.

In practise, this means:

- *developing the open web as a critical component enabling **emergent adaptation to climate change***
- *providing humans with the **legal status and functional capabilities of autonomous agents in a formally open web***  
- *interpreting human rights and the UN's SDGs and capabilities frameworks in terms of autonomous agents in a formally open web* 
- *accelerating the **widespread adoption of the open web platform over commercial silos for personal and organisational data***


Because it centers on human rights, this project is named Pod Zero, the Solid communities' term for *the most local and personal form of data vault.*
